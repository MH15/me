This past year I've been working with a team at [ACCAD](https://accad.osu.edu/) here at Ohio State on a multiplayer Augmented Reality concept. This app used [Unity3D](https://unity.com/) for rendering, object tracking and networking. I became curious if similar technology could be implemented in a web context. I want to experiment with quick demos of Augmented Reality that could be integrated into any website.

## Hesitations
The Augmented Reality demos from Unity run hot on decent Android devices. Is this due to an unomptimized codebase or to hardware limitations? If this was a hardware limitation, web based AR would almost certainly not be worth pursuing. My solution also needed to be cross-platform: as of [May 2020](linkkk) the WebXR standard is only supported by Chrome.
