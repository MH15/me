<!-- ### Quick Info -->

I'm a second year undergraduate student at The Ohio State University studying Computer Science with a specialization in Computer Graphics and Game Design. I am interested in the intersection of the visual arts and technology and work to create interactive experiences and compelling visuals. I'm also an avid photographer.
